<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><strong>CHDataStructures.framework</strong> is an attempt to create a library
  of standard data structures which can be used in any Objective-C program, for
  educational purposes or as a foundation for other data structures to build on.
  Data structures in this framework adopt Objective-C protocols that define the
  functionality of and API for interacting with any implementation thereof,
  regardless of its internals.</p>
<p>This framework provides Objective-C implementations of common data structures
  which are currently beyond the purview of Apple's extensive and flexible
  <a href="http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/">Cocoa frameworks</a>. Collections
  that are a part of Cocoa are highly optimized and amenable to many situations.
  However, sometimes an honest-to-goodness stack, queue, linked list, tree, etc.
  can greatly improve the clarity and comprehensibility of code. The currently
  supported abstract data types include:
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deque">deque</a>,
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)">heap</a>,
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list">linked list</a>,
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(data_structure)">queue</a>,
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(data_structure)">stack</a>, and
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">tree</a>.</p>
<p>The code is written for <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a>
  and does use some features of Objective-C 2.0 (part of 10.5 "Leopard"), but
  most of the code could be easily ported to other Objective-C environments,
  such as <a href="http://www.gnustep.org">GNUStep</a>. However, such efforts
  would be better accomplished by forking this project rather than integrating
  with it, for several main reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Supporting multiple environments increases code complexity, and
    consequently the effort required to test, maintain, and improve it.</li>
  <li>Libraries that have bigger and slower binaries to accommodate all possible
    platforms don't help the mainstream developer.</li>
  <li>Mac OS X is by far the most prevalent Objective-C environment in use, a
    trend which isn't likely to change soon.</li>
</ol>
<p>While certain implementations utilize straight C for their internals, this
  framework is fairly high-level, and uses composition rather than inheritance
  in most cases. The framework was originally written as an exercise in writing
  Objective-C code and consisted mainly of ported Java code. In later revisions,
  performance has gained greater emphasis, but the primary motivation is to
  provide friendly, intuitive Objective-C interfaces for data structures, not to
  maximize speed at any cost, which sometimes happens with C++ and the STL. The
  algorithms should all be sound (i.e., you won't get O(n) performance where it
  should be O(log n) or O(1), etc.) and perform quite well in general. If your
  choice of data structure type and implementation are dependent on performance
  or memory usage, it would be wise to run the benchmarks from Xcode and choose
  based on the time and memory complexity for specific implementations.</p>
  
<p>Binaries and source code for the framework is available
  <a href="http://cocoaheads.byu.edu/code/CHDataStructures/">here</a>. It is
  organized in an Xcode project with all relevant dependencies, but could also
  be built by hand if you're masochistic or just like a challenge.</p>

<p>This README file is also considered a source file under the LGPL, and you

<h2>Contributing to the Framework</h2>
<p>All contributions (including bug reports and fixes, optimizations, new data
  structures, etc.) are welcomed and encouraged. In keeping with this project's
  goals, new features are subject to consideration prior to approval&mdash;there
  are no guarantees of adoption. Modifications that are deemed beneficial to the
  community as a whole will fit with the vision of this project and improve it.
  However, not all potential contributions make sense to add to the framework.
  For example, additions or enhancements that only apply for a specific project
  would be more appropriate to add as categories or subclasses in that code.</p>
