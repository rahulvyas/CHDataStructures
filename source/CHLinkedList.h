/**
 A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list">linked list</a> protocol with
 methods that work in singly- or doubly-linked lists.
 
 This type of data structure is useful for storing sparse data that will be traversed
 often. (Linked lists are very memory efficient when dealing with sparse data, unlike
 hashing and some array schemes.) Insertion and removal at either end of a list is
 extremely fast, but if fast random access (whether insertion, search, or removal) is
 desired, a linked list will generally incur a substantial performance penalty.
 
 Linked lists maintain references to both the start and end of the list, but there is
 no externally-visibly notion of state, such as a "current node". Implementations may
 choose to add indexing or hashing schemes to improve index-based or object-relative
 random access; several optional methods are included to allow such flexibility if
 desired. However, bear in mind that any such additions will increase memory cost and
 diminish the comparative advantages over classes such as NSMutableArray.
 
 Index-based operations are included in this protocol, but users should be aware that
 unless a subclass chooses to use a special indexing scheme, all index-based methods
 in a linked list are O(n). If indexed operations are used frequently, it is likely
 that a better alternative is to use an NSMutableArray.
