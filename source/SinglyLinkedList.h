/**
 A standard singly-linked list implementation with pointers to head and tail. This is
 ideally suited for use in LIFO and FIFO structures (stacks and queues). The lack of
 backwards links prevents backwards enumeration, and removing from the tail of the
 list is O(n), rather than O(1). However, other operations should be slightly faster.
 Nodes are now represented with C structs rather than Obj-C classes, providing much
 faster performance.
