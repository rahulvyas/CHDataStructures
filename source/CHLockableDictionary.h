 A mutable dictionary class with simple built-in locking capabilities.

/**
 A mutable dictionary class with simple built-in locking capabilities.
 
 Since this class extends NSMutableDictionary, it or any of its children may be used anywhere an NSDictionary or NSMutableDictionary is required. It is designed to behave virtually identically to a standard NSMutableDictionary, but with the addition of built-in locking.
 
 An NSLock is used internally to coordinate the operation of multiple threads of execution within the same application, and methods are exposed to allow clients to manipulate the lock in simple ways. Since not all clients will use the lock, it is created lazily the first time a client attempts to acquire the lock.
 
 A CFMutableDictionary is used internally to store the key-value pairs. Subclasses may choose to add other instance variables to enable a specific ordering of keys, override methods to modify behavior, and add methods to extend existing behaviors. However, all subclasses should behave like a standard Cocoa dictionary as much as possible, and document clearly when they do not.
 
 @note Any method inherited from NSDictionary or NSMutableDictionary is supported, but only overridden methods are listed here.
 
 @todo Implement @c -copy and @c -mutableCopy differently (so users can actually obtain an immutable copy) and make mutation methods aware of immutability?
