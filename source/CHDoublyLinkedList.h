/**
 A standard doubly-linked list implementation with pointers to head and tail.
 The extra 'previous' link allows for reverse enumeration and cheap removal from
 the tail of the list. The tradeoff is a little extra storage for each list node
 and a little extra work when inserting and removing. Nodes are now represented
 with C structs rather than Obj-C classes, providing much faster performance.
