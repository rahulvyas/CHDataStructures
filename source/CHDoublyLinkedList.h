 A standard doubly-linked list implementation with pointers to head and tail. The
 extra 'previous' link allows for reverse enumeration and cheap removal from the tail
 of the list. The tradeoff is a little extra storage for each list node, and a little
 extra work when inserting and removing. Nodes are now represented with C structs
 rather than Obj-C classes, providing much faster performance.
