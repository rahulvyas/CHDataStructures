/**
 A circular buffer array with simple built-in locking capabilities. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer">circular buffer</a> is a structure that emulates a continuous ring of N data slots, such that data can be appended without worrying about exceeding the valid indexes of an array. This class uses a C array with start and end indexes to track the front and back of the elements in the buffer. The array is dynamically expanded to accommodate added objects. This type of storage is ideal for scenarios where objects are added and removed only at one or both ends (such as a stack or queue) but still supports all normal NSMutableArray functionality.
 
 Since this class extends NSMutableArray, it or any of its children may be used anywhere an NSArray or NSMutableArray is required. It is designed to behave virtually identically to a standard NSMutableArray, but with the addition of built-in locking.
 
 This class adopts the CHLockable protocol to add simple built-in locking capabilities. An NSLock is used internally to coordinate the operation of multiple threads of execution within the same application, and methods are exposed to allow clients to manipulate the lock in simple ways. Since not all clients will use the lock, it is created lazily the first time a client attempts to acquire the lock.
