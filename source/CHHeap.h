/**
 A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)">heap</a> protocol, suitable for use with many variations of the heap structure.
 
 Objects are "heapified" according to their sorted order, so they must respond to the @c -compare: selector, which accepts another object and returns @c NSOrderedAscending, @c NSOrderedSame, or @c NSOrderedDescending (constants in <a href="http://tinyurl.com/NSComparisonResult">NSComparisonResult</a>) as the receiver is less than, equal to, or greater than the argument, respectively. (Several Cocoa classes already implement the @c -compare: method, including NSString, NSDate, NSNumber, NSDecimalNumber, and NSCell.)
