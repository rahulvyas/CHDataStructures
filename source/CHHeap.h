 A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)">heap</a> protocol,
 suitable for use with many variations of the heap structure.
 
 Since objects in a Heap are inserted according to their sorted order, all objects
 must respond to the <code>compare:</code> selector, which accepts another object
 and returns NSOrderedAscending, NSOrderedSame, or NSOrderedDescending as the
 receiver is less than, equal to, or greater than the argument, respectively. (See
 NSComparisonResult in NSObjCRuntime.h for details.) 
 
 @todo Add support for NSCoding and NSCopying.
