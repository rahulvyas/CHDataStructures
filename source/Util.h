 Convenience function for raising an exception for an invalid range (index).

 Provides a more terse alternative to NSLog() which accepts the same parameters.
 The output is made shorter by excluding the date stamp and process information
 which NSLog prints before the actual specified output.
 
 @param format A format string, which must not be nil.
 @param ... A comma-separated list of arguments to substitute into @a format.
 
 Read <b>Formatting String Objects</b> and <b>String Format Specifiers</b> on
 <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Strings/">
 this webpage</a> for details about using format strings. Look for examples that
 use <code>NSLog()</code>, since the parameters and syntax are idential.

 A macro for including the source file and line number where a log occurred.

 This is defined as a compiler macro so it can automatically fill in the file
 name and line number where the call was made. After printing these values in
 brackets, this macro calls #CHQuietLog with @a format and any other arguments
 supplied afterward.
