/**
 A node used by binary search trees for internal storage and representation.
 
 The nested anonymous union and structs are to provide flexibility for dealing with various types of trees and access. The first union (with pointers to the struct itself) provides 2 distinct yet equivalent ways to access child nodes, based on what is most convenient and efficient. (e.g. 'left' is equivalent to 'link[0]', and 'right' is equivalent to 'link[1]'). The second union (which has integer fields) allows the same node to be used in several different balanced trees, while preserving useful semantic meaning appropriate for each algorithm.

/**
 An abstract CHSearchTree with many default method implementations. Methods for search, size, and enumeration are implemented in this class, as are methods for NSCoding, NSCopying, and NSFastEnumeration. (This works since all child classes use the CHBinaryTreeNode struct.) Any subclass must implement \link #addObject: -addObject:\endlink and \link #removeObject: -removeObject: \endlink such that they conform to the inner workings of that specific subclass.
 
 Rather than enforcing that this class be abstract, the contract is implied. If this class were actually instantiated, it would be of little use since there is attempts to insert or remove will result in runtime exceptions being raised.
 
 Much of the code and algorithms for trees was distilled from information in the <a href="http://eternallyconfuzzled.com/tuts/datastructures/jsw_tut_bst1.aspx">Binary Search Trees tutorial</a>, which is in the public domain, courtesy of <a href="http://eternallyconfuzzled.com/">Julienne Walker</a>. Method names have been changed to match the APIs of existing Cocoa collections provided by Apple.
