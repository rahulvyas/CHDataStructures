/**
 A node used by binary search trees for internal storage and representation.
 
 The nested anonymous union and structs are to provide flexibility for dealing
 with various types of trees and access. The first union (with pointers to the
 struct itself) provides 2 distinct yet equivalent ways to access child nodes,
 based on what is most convenient and efficient. (e.g. 'left' is equivalent to
 'link[0]', and 'right' is equivalent to 'link[1]'). The second union (which has
 integer fields) allows the same node to be used in several different balanced
 trees, while preserving useful semantic meaning appropriate for each algorithm.

/**
 An abstract CHSearchTree with many default method implementations. Methods for
 search, size, and enumeration are implemented in this class, as are methods for
 NSCoding, NSCopying, and NSFastEnumeration. (This works since all child classes
 use the CHBinaryTreeNode struct.) Any subclass must implement \link #addObject:
 -addObject:\endlink and \link #removeObject: -removeObject: \endlink such that
 they conform to the inner workings of that specific subclass.
 
 Rather than enforcing that this class be abstract, the contract is implied. If
 this class were actually instantiated, it would be of little use since there is
 attempts to insert or remove will result in runtime exceptions being raised.
 
 Much of the code and algorithms for trees was distilled from information in the
 <a href="http://eternallyconfuzzled.com/tuts/datastructures/jsw_tut_bst1.aspx">
 Binary Search Trees tutorial</a>, which is in the public domain, courtesy of
 <a href="http://eternallyconfuzzled.com/">Julienne Walker</a>. Method names have
 been changed to match the APIs of existing Cocoa collections provided by Apple.

/**
 An NSEnumerator for traversing a CHAbstractBinarySearchTree subclass in a specified order.
 
 This enumerator uses iterative tree traversal algorithms for two main reasons:
 <ol>
 <li>Recursive algorithms cannot easily be stopped in the middle of a traversal.
 <li>Iterative algorithms are faster since they reduce overhead of function calls.
 </ol>
 
 The stacks and queues used for storing traversal state use malloced C structs
 and <code>\#define</code> pseudo-functions to increase performance and reduce
 the required memory footprint by dynamically allocating as needed.
 
 Enumerators encapsulate their own state, and more than one may be active at once.
 However, like an enumerator for a mutable data structure, any instances of this
 enumerator become invalid if the tree is modified.
