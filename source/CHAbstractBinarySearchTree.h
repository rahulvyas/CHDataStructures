 The nested anonymous union and structs are to provide flexibility for dealing with various types of trees and access. (For those not familiar, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(computer_science)">union</a> is a data structure in which all members are stored at the same memory location, and can take on the value of any of its fields. A union occupies only as much space as the largest member, whereas a struct requires space equal to at least the sum of the size of its members.)
 
 - The first union provides two equivalent ways to access child nodes, based on what is most convenient and efficient. Due to the order in which the fields are declared, <code>left == link[0]</code> and <code>right == link[1]</code>.
 - The second union allows balanced trees to store extra data at each node, using the field name and type that makes sense for its algorithms. This allows for generic reuse while promoting meaningful semantics.
 
 Since CHUnbalancedTree doesn't store any extra data, the second union is essentially 4 bytes of pure overhead per node. However, since unbalanced trees are generally not a good choice for sorting large data sets anyway, this is largely a moot point.

/**
 An abstract CHSearchTree with many default method implementations. Methods for search, size, and enumeration are implemented in this class, as are methods for NSCoding, NSCopying, and NSFastEnumeration. (This works since all child classes use the CHBinaryTreeNode struct.) Any subclass @b must implement \link #addObject: -addObject:\endlink and \link #removeObject: -removeObject:\endlink according to the inner workings of that specific tree, and @b should also override \link #dotGraphStringForNode: -dotGraphStringForNode:\endlink and \link #debugDescriptionForNode: -debugDescriptionForNode:\endlink to display any algorithm-specific information in generated DOT graphs and debugging output, respectively.
 
 Rather than enforcing that this class be abstract, the contract is implied. If this class were actually instantiated, it would be of little use since there is attempts to insert or remove will result in runtime exceptions being raised.
 
 Much of the code and algorithms for trees was distilled from information in the <a href="http://eternallyconfuzzled.com/tuts/datastructures/jsw_tut_bst1.aspx">Binary Search Trees tutorial</a>, which is in the public domain, courtesy of <a href="http://eternallyconfuzzled.com/">Julienne Walker</a>. Method names have been changed to match the APIs of existing Cocoa collections provided by Apple.
