/**
 @file CHAbstractBinarySearchTree_Internal.h
 Contains \#defines for performing various traversals of binary search trees.
 
 This file is a private header that is only used by internal implementations,
 and is not included in the the compiled framework. The memory (re)allocated for
 stacks and queues is obtained using NSScannedOption because the nodes which may
 be placed in a stack or queue are known to the garbage collector. Since a stack
 or queue is only used in connection with a tree that is active (usually during
 insertion, removal or iteration) this should not leak. The macros and variables
 are internal and/or private, we assume that the stack or queue will not outlive
 the underlying nodes, but this behavior may not be threadsafe.
