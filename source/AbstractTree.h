/**
 An abstract Tree implementation with some default method implementations. Methods
 for insertion, search, removal and order-specific enumeration must be re-implemented
 by child classes so as to conform to their inner workings. The methods defined in
 this abstract class rely on the implementations of such operations, so they cannot
 be implemented here.
 
 Rather than enforcing that this class be abstract, the contract is implied. In any
 case, if this class is actually instantiated, it will be of little use since all the
 methods for insertion, removal, and search are unsupported and raise exceptions.
