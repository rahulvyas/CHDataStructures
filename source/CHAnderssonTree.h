/**
 An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA_tree">AA-tree</a>, a balanced binary
 search tree with guaranteed O(log n) access. The algorithms for insertion and
 removal have been adapted from code in the
 <a href="http://eternallyconfuzzled.com/tuts/datastructures/jsw_tut_andersson.aspx">
 Andersson Tree tutorial</a>, which is in the public domain, courtesy of <a href=
 "http://eternallyconfuzzled.com/">Julienne Walker</a>. Method names have been
 changed to match the APIs of existing Cocoa collections provided by Apple.
 
 The AA-tree (named after its creator, Arne Andersson) is extremely similar to a
 Red-Black tree. Both are abstractions of B-trees designed to make insertion and
 removal easier to understand and implement. In a Red-Black tree, a red node
 represents a horizontal link to a subtree rooted at the same level. In the
 AA-tree, horizontal links are represented by storing a node's level, not color.
 (A node whose level is the same as its parent is equivalent to a "red" node.)
 
 Similar to a Red-Black tree, there are several rules which must be true for an
 AA-tree to remain valid:
 
 <ol>
 <li>The level of a leaf node is one.</li>
 <li>The level of a left child is less than that of its parent.</li>
 <li>The level of a right child is less than or equal to that of its parent.</li>
 <li>The level of a right grandchild is less than that of its grandparent.</li>
 <li>Every node of level greater than one must have two children.</li>
 </ol>

 The AA-tree was invented to simplify the algorithms for balancing an abstract
 B-tree, and does so with  a simple restriction: horizontal links ("red nodes")
 are only allowed as the right child of a node. If we represent both node level
 and the implicit red colors, an AA-tree looks like the following example:
 
 <center>
 <b>Figure 1 - A sample AA-tree with node levels and implicit coloring.</b><br>

 </center>
 
 Because horizontal links are only allowed on the right, rather than balancing
 all 7 possible subtrees of 2 and 3 nodes (shown in Figure 2) when removing, an
 AA-tree need only be concerned with 2: the first and last forms in the figure.
 
 <center>

 </center>
 
 Consequently, only two primitive balancing operations are necessary. The
 <code>skew</code> operation eliminates red nodes as left children, while the
 <code>split</code> operation eliminates consecutive right-child red nodes.
 (Both of these operations are depicted in the figures below.)

 <b>Figure 4 - The split operation.</b><br>

 </center>
 
 Performance of an AA-tree is roughly equivalent to that of a Red-Black tree.
 While an AA-tree makes more rotations than a Red-Black tree, the algorithms are
 simpler to understand and tend to be somewhat faster, and all of this balances
 out to result in similar performance. A Red-Black tree is more consistent in
 its performance than an AA-tree, but an AA-tree tends to be flatter, which
 results in slightly faster search.

 AA-trees were originally described in the following paper:
