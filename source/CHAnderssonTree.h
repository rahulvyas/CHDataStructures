/**
 An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA_tree">AA-tree</a>, a balanced binary
 tree with guaranteed O(log n) access. This is an Objective-C port of the AA-tree
 from <i>"Data Structures and Problem Solving Using Java"</i> by Mark Allen Weiss,
 published by Addison Wesley. Method names have been changed to match the APIs of
 existing Cocoa collections classes provided by Apple, and several optimizations in 
 straight C have been made to optimize speed and memory usage.
 
 An <i>Arne Andersson tree</i> is similar to a RedBlackTree, but with
 a simple restriction that simplifies maintenance operations for balancing the tree.
 Rather than balancing all 7 possible subtrees of 2 and 3 nodes, an AA-tree need only
 be concerned with 2, so consequently only 2 operations&mdash;called <i>skew</i> and
 <i>split</i>, or left and right rotations, respectively&mdash;are required.

 The performance of an AA-tree is equivalent to the performance of a Red-Black tree.
 While an AA-tree makes more rotations than a Red-Black tree, the simpler algorithms
 tend to be faster, and all of this balances out to result in similar performance. A
 Red-Black tree is more consistent in its performance than an AA-tree, but an AA-tree
 tends to be flatter, which results in slightly faster search times.
