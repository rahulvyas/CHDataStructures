 A standard doubly-linked list implementation with pointers to head and tail.
 I call it standard because I have no plans to implement a singly-linked list...
 Does the extra pointer for each node really add that much excess?
 
 Nodes are now represented with C structs rather than Obj-C classes, providing much
 faster performance. (Thanks to Max Horn for the suggestion and additional guidance.)
 The protocols and interfaces also follow Apple's collection APIs more closely.
