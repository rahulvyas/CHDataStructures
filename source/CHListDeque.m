#import "CHListDeque.h"

/**
 This implementation uses a CHDoublyLinkedList, since a deque supports insertion and
 removal at both ends, and removing from the tail of a singly-linked list is an O(n)
 operation. The trade-off to this speed increase is marginally higher storage cost,
 and marginally slower operations due to handling the reverse links. This also allows
 for reverse enumeration of objects in the deque.
