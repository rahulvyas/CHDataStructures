/**
 @mainpage Overview
 
 This framework provides Objective-C protocols for and implementations of common
 data structures which are currently beyond the purview of Apple's extensive and
 flexible <a href="http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/">Cocoa frameworks</a>. The
 collections which are a part of Cocoa (NSArray, NSDictionary, NSSet, etc.) are
 highly optimized and amenable to many situations. Even so, sometimes the use of
 an honest-to-goodness stack, queue, linked list, tree, etc. can greatly improve
 the clarity and comprehensibility of code.
 
 This framework is an attempt to create a library of standard data structures
 which can be reliably used in any Objective-C program. Data structures in this
 framework adopt Objective-C protocols which define the functionality of and API
 for interacting with any implementation thereof, regardless of its internals.
 
 The data structure protocols include:
 - CHDeque
 - CHHeap
 - CHLinkedList
 - CHQueue
 - CHStack
 - CHTree
 
 This framework targets <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a>, but
 most of the code could be easily ported to other Objective-C environments, such
 as <a href="http://www.gnustep.org">GNUStep</a>. However, such efforts would be
 better accomplished by forking this project rather than integrating with it,
 for two primary reasons:
 
 <ol>
 <li>Accommodating multiple environments dramatically increases code complexity,
     and consequently the effort required to test, maintain, and improve it.
 <li>OS X is by far the most prevalent Objective-C environment in use, and
     bigger, slower library binaries are a disservice to any developer.
 </ol>
