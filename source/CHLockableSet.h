/**
 A mutable set class with simple built-in locking capabilities.

 Since this class extends NSMutableSet, it or any of its children may be used anywhere an NSSet or NSMutableSet is required. It is designed to behave virtually identically to a standard NSMutableSet, but with the addition of built-in locking.
 
 An NSLock is used internally to coordinate the operation of multiple threads of execution within the same application, and methods are exposed to allow clients to manipulate the lock in simple ways. Since not all clients will use the lock, it is created lazily the first time a client attempts to acquire the lock.
 
 A CFMutableSetRef is used internally to store the key-value pairs. Subclasses may choose to add other instance variables to enable a specific ordering of keys, override methods to modify behavior, and add methods to extend existing behaviors. However, all subclasses should behave like a standard Cocoa dictionary as much as possible, and document clearly when they do not.
 
 @note Any method inherited from NSSet or NSMutableSet is supported by this class and its children. Please see the documentation for those classes for details.
