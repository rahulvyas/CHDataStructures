/**
 A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_trees">Red-Black tree</a>, a
 balanced binary tree with guaranteed O(log n) access. This is an Objective-C port of
 the Red-Black tree from <i>"Data Structures and Problem Solving Using Java"</i>
 by Mark Allen Weiss, published by Addison Wesley. Method names have been changed to
 match the APIs of existing Cocoa collections classes provided by Apple, and several
 optimizations in straight C have been made to optimize speed and memory usage.

 A Red-Black tree has four fundamental rules: (taken from the book mentioned above)
 <ol>
 <li>Every node is red or black.
 <li>The root is black.
 <li>If a node is red, its children must be black.
 <li>Every path from a node to a null link must contain the same number of black nodes.
 </ol>
 
 Also note that <code>nil</code> nodes are considered black for many purposes.
 This is really hard to make work right. For me at least.
