/**
 A simple abstract parent class for adding simple built-in locking capabilities.
 An NSLock is used internally to coordinate the operation of multiple threads of
 execution within the same application, and methods are exposed to allow clients
 to manipulate the lock in simple ways. Since not all clients will use the lock,
 it is created lazily the first time a client attempts to acquire the lock.

 Attempts to acquire a lock, blocking a thread's execution until the lock can be
