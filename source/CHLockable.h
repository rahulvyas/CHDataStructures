/**
 A simple protocol for adding simple built-in locking capabilities. The methods are intended to be use a lock that is an instance variable of the implementing class. The protocol  adopts the NSLocking protocol (which includes the \link NSLocking#lock -lock\endlink and \link NSLocking#unlock -unlock\endlink methods) as a convenience for users that may wish to statically type instances of this class or its children as @c id<NSLocking> as a hint for compile-time type checking.

 @warning NSLock uses POSIX threads to implement its locking behavior.

Unlocking a lock from a different thread can cause undefined behavior.
