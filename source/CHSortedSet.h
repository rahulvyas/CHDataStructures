/**
 A protocol which specifes an interface for sorted sets.
 
 A <strong>sorted set</strong> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(computer_science)">set</a> that further provides a <em>total ordering</em> on its elements. This protocol defines sorted set methods for insertion, removal, search, and object enumeration. Though any conforming class must implement all these methods, they may document that certain of them are unsupported, and/or raise exceptions when they are called.
 
 In a sorted set, objects are inserted according to their sorted order, so they must respond to the @c -compare: selector, which accepts another object and returns @c NSOrderedAscending, @c NSOrderedSame, or @c NSOrderedDescending (constants in <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Miscellaneous/Foundation_DataTypes/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/tdef/NSComparisonResult">NSComparisonResult</a>) as the receiver is less than, equal to, or greater than the argument, respectively. (Several Cocoa classes already implement the @c -compare: method, including NSString, NSDate, NSNumber, NSDecimalNumber, and NSCell.)
 
 Java includes a <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/SortedSet.html">SortedSet</a> interface as part of the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/collections/">Java Collections Framework</a>. Many other programming languages also have sorted sets, most commonly implemented as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree">binary search trees</a>.
 
 @see CHSearchTree
 
 @todo Add more operations similar to those supported by NSSet and NSMutableSet, such as:
	- <code>- (NSArray*) allObjectsFilteredUsingPredicate:</code>
	- <code>- (void) filterUsingPredicate:</code>
	- <code>- (BOOL) isEqualToSortedSet:</code>
	- <code>- (BOOL) isSubsetOfSortedSet:</code>
	- <code>- (BOOL) intersectsSet:</code>
	- <code>- (void) intersectSet:</code>
	- <code>- (void) minusSet:</code>
	- <code>- (void) unionSet:</code>
 
 @todo Add <code>-subsetFromObject:toObject:</code> to return a new subset instance with new nodes pointing to the same objects. If an object matches one of the parameters, it is included. (Neither parameter must be a member of the set. Either parameter may be nil to designate the first/last element in the set. If the first object is greater than the second, should the result include elements sliced from both ends?) See Java's <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/SortedSet.html">SortedSet</a> for ideas.
 
 @todo Consider adding other possible sorted set implementations, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list">skip lists</a>, <a href="http://www.concentric.net/~Ttwang/tech/sorthash.htm">sorted linear hash sets</a>, and <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/230113/">sorted lists</a>.
