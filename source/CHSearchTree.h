/**
 A protocol which specifes an interface for search trees, whether the customary
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree">binary tree</a>, an
 N-ary tree structure, or any similary tree-like structure. The protocol defines
 methods that support insertion, removal, search, and object enumeration. Though
 any conforming class must implement all these methods, they may document that
 certain of them are unsupported, and/or raise exceptions when they are called.
 
 Objects are stored according to their sorted order, so they must respond to the
 <code>compare:</code> selector, which accepts another object and returns one of
 <code>{NSOrderedAscending | NSOrderedSame | NSOrderedDescending}</code> as the
 receiver is less than, equal to, or greater than the argument.
 (See <code>NSComparisonResult</code> in NSObjCRuntime.h for details.)
 
 There are several methods for visiting each node in a tree data structure, known
 as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal">tree traversal</a>
 techniques. (Traversal applies to N-ary trees, not just binary trees.) Whereas
 linked lists and arrays have one or two logical means of stepping through the
 elements, because trees are branching structures, there are many different ways
 to choose how to visit all of the nodes. There are 5 most commonly-used tree
 traversal methods; of these, 4 are depth first and 1 is breadth-first. These
 methods are described below:
 
 <table align="center" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0">
 <tr>
 <td style="vertical-align: bottom">
	@image html tree-traversal.png "Figure 1 — A sample binary search tree."
 </td>
 <td style="vertical-align: bottom" align="center">
 
 <table style="border-collapse: collapse;">
 <tr style="background: #ddd;">
     <th>Traversal</th>     <th>Visit Order</th> <th>Node Ordering</th>
 </tr>
 <tr><td>In-order</td>	    <td>L, node, R</td>  <td>A B C D E F G H I</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Reverse-order</td> <td>R, node, L</td>  <td>I H G F E D C B A</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Pre-order</td>	    <td>node, L, R</td>  <td>F B A D C E G I H</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Post-order</td>	<td>L, R, node</td>  <td>A C E D B H I G F</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Level-order</td>	<td>L→R, T→B</td>    <td>F B G A D I C E H</td></tr>
 </table>
 <p><strong>Table 1 - Various tree traversals on Figure 1.</strong></p>
 
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 These orderings correspond to the following constants, respectively:
 
 - <code>CHTraverseAscending</code>
 - <code>CHTraverseDescending</code>
 - <code>CHTraversePreOrder</code>
 - <code>CHTraversePostOrder</code>
 - <code>CHTraverseLevelOrder</code>
 
 These constants are used primarily for enumerating over search trees (see @link
 #objectEnumeratorWithTraversalOrder: -objectEnumeratorWithTraversalOrder:
 \endlink) to access objects from a tree by traversing it in a specified order.
