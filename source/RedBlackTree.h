/**
 A fast, balanced, non-recursive binary tree with guaranteed O(log n) access. This
 class is a direct Objective-C port of the Red Black tree found in "Data Structures
 and Problem Solving Using Java" by Mark Allen Weiss, published by Addison Wesley.

 There are four fundamental rules: (taken from the book mentioned above)
 <ol>
 <li>Every node is red or black.
 <li>The root is black.
 <li>If a node is red, its children must be black.
 <li>Every path from a node to a null link must contain the same number of black nodes.
 </ol>
 
 Also note that <code>nil</code> nodes are considered black for many purposes.
 This is really hard to make work right. For me at least.
