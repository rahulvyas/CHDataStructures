#import "CHLockableDictionary.h"

/**
 A dictionary which enumerates keys in the order in which they are inserted. The following additional operations are provided to take advantage of the ordering:
   - \link #firstKey -firstKey\endlink
   - \link #lastKey -lastKey\endlink
   - \link #keyAtIndex: -keyAtIndex:\endlink
   - \link #reverseKeyEnumerator -reverseKeyEnumerator\endlink
 
 Key-value entries are inserted just as in a normal dictionary, including replacement of values for existing keys, as detailed in \link #setObject:forKey: -setObject:forKey:\endlink. However, an additional structure is used in parallel to track insertion order, and keys are enumerated in that order. If a key to be added does not currently exist in the dictionary, it is added to the end of the list, otherwise the insertion order of the key does not change.

 Implementations of insertion-ordered dictionaries (aka "maps") in other languages include the following:
 
 - <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html">LinkedHashMap</a> in Java SE
 - <a href="http://commons.apache.org/collections/apidocs/org/apache/commons/collections/map/LinkedMap.html">LinkedMap</a> in Apache Commons
 - <a href="http://sano.luaforge.net/documentation/LinkedMap.html">LinkedMap</a> in Lua
 - <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0372/">OrderedDict</a> in Python
 - <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.specialized.ordereddictionary.aspx">OrderedDictionary</a> in .NET
 - <a href="http://codeendeavor.com/gsdocs/net/guttershark/util/collections/OrderedDictionary.html">OrderedDictionary</a> in Flash
 
 @note Any method inherited from NSDictionary or NSMutableDictionary is supported, but only overridden methods are listed here.
