/**
 An abstract CHTree implementation with some default method implementations. Methods
 for insertion, search, removal and order-specific enumeration must be re-implemented
 by child classes so as to conform to their inner workings. The methods defined in
 this abstract class rely on the implementations of such operations, so they cannot
 be implemented here.
 
 Rather than enforcing that this class be abstract, the contract is implied. In any
 case, if this class is actually instantiated, it will be of little use since all the
 methods for insertion, removal, and search are unsupported and raise exceptions.

 A dummy object that resides in the header node for a tree. Using a header node
 can simplify insertion logic by eliminating the need to check whether the root
 is null. In such cases, the tree root is generally stored as the right child of
 the header. In order to always proceed to the right child when traversing down
 the tree, instances of this class always return <code>NSOrderedAscending</code>

/**
 A node used by balanced binary trees for internal storage and representation.
 
 The nested anonymous union and structs are to provide flexibility for dealing
 with various types of trees and access. The first union—with pointers to the
 struct itself—provide 2 ways to access child nodes at the same memory address,
 based on what is most convenient and efficient. (e.g. 'left' is equivalent to
 'link[0]', and 'right' is equivalent to 'link[1]'). The second union—with the
 NSUInteger values—allows the same node to be used in several different balanced
 trees, while preserving useful semantic meaning appropriate for each algorithm.
