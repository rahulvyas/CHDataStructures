/**
 A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">tree</a> protocol
 which specifes an interface for N-ary tree structures. Defines methods to
 support insertion, removal, search, and element enumeration. This protocol works for
 trees where nodes have any number of children, not just binary trees. Although any
 conforming class must implement all these methods, they may document that certain of
 them are unsupported, and/or raise exceptions when they are called.
 
 Objects in a Tree are inserted according to their sorted order, so they must respond
 to the <code>compare:</code> selector, which accepts another object and returns one
 of <code>{NSOrderedAscending | NSOrderedSame | NSOrderedDescending}</code> as the
 receiver is less than, equal to, or greater than the argument, respectively. (See
 <code>NSComparisonResult</code> in NSObjCRuntime.h for details.)
 
 There are several methods for visiting each node in a tree data structure, known as
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal">tree traversal</a> techniques.
 (Traversal applies to N-ary trees, not just binary trees.) Whereas linked lists and
 arrays have one or two logical means of stepping through the elements, because trees
 are branching structures, there are many different ways to choose how to visit all
 of the nodes. There are 5 most commonly-used tree traversal methods; of these, 4 are
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_traversal">depth-first</a> and 1
 is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_traversal">breadth-first</a>.
 These methods are described below:
 
 <table align="center" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0">
 <tr>
 <td style="vertical-align: bottom">
	@image html tree-traversal.png "Figure 1 — A sample binary tree."
 </td>
 <td style="vertical-align: bottom" align="center">
 
 <table style="border-collapse: collapse;">
 <tr style="background: #ddd;">
     <th>Traversal</th>     <th>Visit Order</th> <th>Node Ordering</th>
 </tr>
 <tr><td>In-order</td>	    <td>L, node, R</td>  <td>A B C D E F G H I</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Reverse-order</td> <td>R, node, L</td>  <td>I H G F E D C B A</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Pre-order</td>	    <td>node, L, R</td>  <td>F B A D C E G I H</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Post-order</td>	<td>L, R, node</td>  <td>A C E D B H I G F</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Level-order</td>	<td>L→R, T→B</td>    <td>F B G A D I C E H</td></tr>
 </table>
 <p><strong>Table 1 - Various tree traversals on Figure 1.</strong></p>
 
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 These orderings correspond to the following constants, also declared in CHTree.h:
 
 - <code>CHTraverseInOrder</code>
 - <code>CHTraverseReverseOrder</code>
 - <code>CHTraversePreOrder</code>
 - <code>CHTraversePostOrder</code>
 - <code>CHTraverseLevelOrder</code>
 
 These constants are used primarily with @link #objectEnumeratorWithTraversalOrder:
 -[Tree objectEnumeratorWithTraversalOrder:]@endlink to obtain an NSEnumerator that
 provides objects from the tree by traversing using the specified order.
