 @file CHAbstractMutableArrayCollection.h
 An abstract class which implements common behaviors of array-based collections.
 */

/**
 An abstract class which implements common behaviors of array-based collections.
 This class has a single instance variable on which all the implemented methods
 act, and also conforms to several protocols:
 
 - NSCoding
 - NSCopying
 - NSFastEnumeration
 
 This class also contains concrete implementations for the following methods:
 
 <pre><code>
 -(id) initWithArray:
 -(NSUInteger) count
 -(NSString*) description
 -(NSEnumerator*) objectEnumerator
 -(NSEnumerator*) reverseObjectEnumerator
 -(NSArray*) allObjects
 -(void) removeObject:
 -(void) removeAllObjects
 
 -(BOOL) containsObject:
 -(BOOL) containsObjectIdenticalTo:
 -(NSUInteger) indexOfObject:
 -(NSUInteger) indexOfObjectIdenticalTo:
 -(id) objectAtIndex:
 </code></pre>

 Rather than enforcing that this class be abstract, the contract is implied. In
 any case, an instance would be useless since there is no way to add objects.

 Returns a new instance that's a copy of the receiver. Invoked automatically by

        from the default zone. (<code>-copy</code> invokes with a NULL param.)
 
 The returned object is implicitly retained by the sender, who is responsible
 for releasing it. Copies returned by this method are always mutable.
