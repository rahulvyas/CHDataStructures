 A simple, unbalanced binary tree that <b>does not</b> guarantee O(log n) access.
 Even though the tree is never balanced when items are added or removed, access is
 <b>at worst</b> linear if the tree essentially degenerates into a linked list.
 This class is fast, and without stack risk because it works without recursion.
 In release 0.4.0, nodes objects were changed to C structs for enhanced performance.
